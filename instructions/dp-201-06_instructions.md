# DP 201 - Designing an Azure Data Platform Solution.
# Lab 6 - Designing for Efficiency and Operations.

**Estimated Time**: 60 minutes

**Pre-requisites**: It is assumed that the case study for this lab has already been read.

**Lab files**: The files for this lab are located in the _Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-200.6_ folder.

## Lab overview

The students will explore way in which they can maximise the efficiency of using a cloud environment and how they can monitor and analyze operational efficiencies from the Azure portal. They will also look at how automation can be used to reduce effort and error.

## Lab objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Maximize the Efficiency of your Cloud Environment
1. Use Monitoring and Analytics to Gain Operational Insights
1. Use Automation to Reduce Effort and Error

## Scenario
  
You have recently been hired as a senior data engineer at AdventureWorks and are working on building a cloud data platform solution that meets the organizations technical and business requirements.

The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) has expressed concerns that she does not want the costs of running the infrastructure to “spiral out of control”. She would like assurances that the information services team are operating the supporting services as efficiently as possible and she would like to know what steps are being taken to get information that provides evidence of how the environment is being used.

In addition, the CIO wants to gain an understanding how the team can monitor the systems and work efficiently through automation and would like an overview of what can be done to ensure that administrative effort can be reduced through automation.

At the end of this lab, you will have:

1. Maximize the Efficiency of your Cloud Environment
1. Use Monitoring and Analytics to Gain Operational Insights
1. Use Automation to Reduce Effort and Error

## Exercise 1: Maximize the Efficiency of your Cloud Environment.

**Group exercise**
  
The main task for this exercise are as follows:

1. Provide a link to the Azure Price Calculator and a list of best practise that the IS department should follow to minimize costs.

### Task 1: Provide a link to the Azure Price Calculator and a list of best practises to minimize costs.

1. From the lab virtual machine, start **Microsoft Word**, and open up the file **DP-200-Lab06-Ex01_Ta01.docx** from the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-200.6** folder.

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** discussing and listing the best practise that the IS department should follow to minimize costs.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a Microsoft Word document that provides a link to the Azure Price Calculator and a list of best practises to minimize costs.

## Exercise 2: Use Monitoring and Analytics to Gain Operational Insights

**Group exercise**
  
The main task for this exercise are as follows:

1. Draft a monitoring and analytics strategy that should be adopted by AdventureWorks

### Task 1: Provide a link to the Azure Price Calculator and a list of best practises to minimize costs.

1. From the lab virtual machine, start **Microsoft Word**, and open up the file **DP-200-Lab06-Ex02_Ta01.docx** from the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-200.6** folder.

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** discussing and drafting a monitoring and analytics strategy that should be adopted by AdventureWorks.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a Microsoft Word document that provides a monitoring and analytics strategy that should be adopted by AdventureWorks.

## Exercise 3: Use Automation to Reduce Effort and Error

**Group exercise**
  
The main task for this exercise are as follows:

1. List the options for automation languages and approaches

### Task 1: Provide a link to the Azure Price Calculator and a list of best practises to minimize costs.

1. From the lab virtual machine, start **Microsoft Word**, and open up the file **DP-200-Lab06-Ex0_Ta01.docx** from the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-200.6** folder.

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** list the options for automation languages and approaches. Describe the difference between imperative and declarative automation.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a Microsoft Word document with a list the options for automation languages and approaches.
