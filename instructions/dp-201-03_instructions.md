# DP 201 - Designing an Azure Data Platform Solution.
# Lab 3 - Azure Real-Time Reference Architectures.

**Estimated Time**: 60 minutes

**Pre-requisites**: It is assumed that the case study for this lab has already been read.

**Lab files**: The files for this lab are located in the _Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-201.3_ folder.

## Lab overview

The students will use the case study to identify which business and technical requirements relate to a Lambda architecture from a real-time perspective. The student will then architect a streaming pipeline with Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Databricks. Finally, the students will attempt to design an IoT architecture as it relates to the meeting of the AdventureWorks business requirements.

## Lab objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Architect a stream processing pipeline with Azure Stream Analytics
1. Design a stream processing pipeline with Azure Databricks.
1. Create an Azure IoT reference architecture

## Scenario
  
You are the senior data engineer of AdventureWorks. You are designing and architecting a solution that will deal with the real-time processing of data. You have been advised that the solution architecture should take a holistic view of all the business requirements and your proposal should be presented in a Word document.

You will first identify which AdventureWorks requirements fits into real-time processing of a Lambda architecture. You will then provide an architecture for a stream processing pipeline with Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Databricks. You will also design a first pass on an IoT architecture.

At the end of this lab, you will have:

1. Architect a stream processing pipeline with Azure Stream Analytics.
1. Design a stream processing pipeline with Azure Databricks.
1. Create an Azure IoT reference architecture.

>**Note**: This lab is in two parts. This is part 1 where you work as a group to answer the questions. The timings of each exercise is at the discretion of the group. The entire lab should be completed within 60 minutes. In Part 2, the instructor will drive a discussion with the group about their learnings and findings about the Lab.

>**Resources**: As well as the using the course case study for this lab, you use also use resources such a [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com), the [Azure Reference Architecture Site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/) and the [Microsoft Customer Stories Site](https://customers.microsoft.com/) to help inform you in answering questions in this lab.

## Exercise 1: Architect a stream processing pipeline with Azure Stream Analytics.

**Group exercise**
  
The main task for this exercise is as follows:

1. From the case study, identify the requirements that would form part of the real-time processing of data in AdventureWorks.

1. Build a high level Architecture that reflects a stream processing pipeline with Azure Stream Analytics.

### Task 1: List real-time processing requirements for AdventureWorks

1. From your machine, start **Microsoft Word**, and open up the file **DP-201-Lab03_Ex01_Ta01.docx** from the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-201.3** folder.

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** discussing and listing the requirements that would form part of a real-time solution in AdventureWorks. Evidence should be provided from the case study.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a Microsoft Word document that shows a table real time processing requirements for AdventureWorks.

### Task 2: Build a high level architecture that reflects a stream processing pipeline with Azure Stream Analytics.

1. From your machine, start **Microsoft Word**, and open up the file **DP-201-Lab03_Ex01_Ta02.docx** from the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-201.3** folder.

1. As a group, spend **20 minutes** discussing and diagraming the architectures that would form part of the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks. You can use the png files in the icon folder to build your architecture.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created architectures that would form part of the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.

## Exercise 2: Design a stream processing pipeline with Azure Databricks.

**Group exercise**
  
The main task for this exercise is as follows:

1. Create a high level Architecture to include a stream processing pipeline with Azure Databricks solution in AdventureWorks.

### Task 1: Create a high level architecture to include a stream processing pipeline with Azure Databricks solution in AdventureWorks.

1. From your machine, start **Microsoft Word**, and open up the file **DP-201-Lab03_Ex02_Ta01.docx** from the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-201.3** folder. Read the document and review the example.

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** creating an architecture that meets the requirements of the predictive maintenance of bicycles.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a stream processing pipeline with Azure Databricks solution in AdventureWorks.

## Exercise 3: Create an Azure IoT reference architecture.

**Group exercise**
  
The main task for this exercise is as follows:

1. Confirming which architecture created would form part of an Azure IoT reference architecture.

### Task 1: Create an Azure IoT reference architecture.

1. As a group, spend **5 minutes** discussing and confirming which architecture that you have created so far that would form part of an Azure IoT reference architecture.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created an architecture to include an Enterprise-grade conversational bot in Azure.

## Lab Review

After approximately 60 minutes, the instructor will bring a close to this lab. The class will discuss the findings of each group.
